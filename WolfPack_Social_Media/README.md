1. Interesting challenge for me during this homework is the API endpoint. For the first few tries, I don't really understand how it works.
Also, I didn't know that I have to make each endpoint path unique for the the api client to find the correct one. After a few tried, I understood how 
each endpoint works and when the API client call, it looks for a path that fit. 
2. One additional feature that come to me is user has ability to set music to play when other users visit their profile page. I think this is fairly simple
I have to make additional json file for the audio and assign it to each users via their userId.
